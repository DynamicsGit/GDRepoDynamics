Functional Design Document (FDD): C&C CRM MVP Journey Planning

1. Introduction
This Functional Design Document (FDD) provides a comprehensive blueprint for the C&C CRM MVP Journey Planning solution, targeting the automation, optimization, and management of sales journeys and customer/prospect calls for Account Sales Managers (ASMs) and sales leadership. The solution leverages Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (D365 CE), supporting business productivity, compliance, sales effectiveness, and robust reporting via automation, mobile/offline capability, and seamless integrations. All requirements are mapped to technical components and D365 modules for traceability.

2. Scope
2.1 In Scope
* Automated scheduling of sales calls for existing customers using tiering and business logic.
* Manual and system-assisted scheduling/rescheduling of customer and prospect calls.
* Enforcement of daily minimum (7) and maximum (9) calls per ASM.
* Journey planning that considers holidays, opening hours, ASM leave, and Outlook calendar integration.
* Definition and management of home, start, and end locations for journeys.
* Inclusion of both Account and Prospect calls (minimum 2 prospects per day).
* Route optimization for circular/efficient journeys including walking, public, and private transport.
* Visual mapping of journeys by day and week.
* Rolling journey plans (weekly and 4-week) with dynamic refresh.
* Communication of confirmed and walk-in appointments, with rescheduling and reason codes.
* Integration with Outlook for calendar sync and availability.
* Integration with navigation/mobile apps (Google Maps, Waze, Bing Maps).
* Management and performance reporting.
* Mobile and offline access for ASMs.
* Data migration/import (historical calls, journey plans, tiering, etc.).
2.2 Out of Scope
* Marketing automation, campaign management.
* Telephony/messaging not related to appointment notifications.
* HR, payroll, and finance processes.
* Custom/external customer or prospect self-service portals.
* Non-sales operational workflows.
