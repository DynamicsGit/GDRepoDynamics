Functional Design Document (FDD)
C&C CRM MVP Journey Planning

1. Introduction
This Functional Design Document (FDD) details the requirements and solution approach for C&C’s CRM MVP Journey Planning. The objective is to enable efficient, automated, and optimized sales journey planning for Account Sales Managers (ASMs) and their management. The solution ensures calls are scheduled and executed in line with business rules, customer tiering, and real-world constraints, leveraging Dynamics 365 CE and associated technologies.

2. Scope
In Scope
* Automated and manual sales call scheduling (customer tiering, business rules)
* Rolling journey planning with optimization (visit count, geography, transport, calendar)
* Integration with Dynamics CRM, Outlook, and mobile navigation apps
* Mobile and offline access for ASMs
* Management reporting and analytics (planned and actual activities)
* Exception handling (rescheduling, walk-ins, productivity optimization)
Out of Scope
* Full customer onboarding process
* Advanced AI-based journey optimization beyond route calculation
* Deep integration with third-party analytics/BI tools (except Power BI)
* Non-sales team journey planning
